Windows 11 utility scripts for WSL2 Backup and Restore of Containers
Author: Mark Ryan (terminatedprocess)

Overview:
The concept behind this script system is that you will backup using a script file. The backup script will backup your WSL container and date/time stamp it.  To restore, you would find the backup file, right-click it, and select RestoreToWSL. See below:

Caveats:
These tools should be cloned to c:\development\tools\wsltools. You can, of course, change this to your preferences, but will need to search for and replace the path with your custom path.

Tools:
1. setRestoreTOWSLUbuntu.reg
   -  Registry file to install a right-click option for restoring .vhdx files. DISCLAIMER - PLEASE READ FILE FIRST FOR YOUR OWN PEACE OF MIND.
   -  Once added to your registry, you can right-click on a .vdhx file and select <b>RestoreToWSL</b>.
   -  There are no stops here. If you right-click a .vdhx file and select this option to restore, it will replace your 
      current Ubuntu with the saved copy. 

6. bkupwslubuntu.ps1
   - On first run, you will be asked to enter the backup directory. This directory will contain a sub-folder for each distro.
   
   - Since VSCODE and Docker Desktop can interfere with the backup, a check is performed. 
     a. If VSCODE is running, just quit.
     b. If Docker Desktop is running, use the taskbar icon in the toolbar tray (far right icons) to QUIT DOCKER.
   
   - This backup routine will collect a list of WSL2 instances. If only one instance is found, it will just proceed with the backup. 
     If more than one, it will allow you to select which instance you want to backup, defaulting to the last instance selected.
   
   - Selected distro will be backed up and saved to backup directory in a sub-folder matching the instance name.
     For example, if backup directory is c:/wslbackups (default), and you are backing up ubuntu, the destination directory is c:/wslbackups/ubuntu.
     Inside this directory will be placed a backup with the format of <<instance name>>-datetimestamp.vdhx
   
   - THe last instance selected and the backup directory are stored in file wslbackup.ini. This file is in the same location as the powershell scripts.
  
8. rbkupwslubuntu.bat
   - First install the setRestoreToWslUbuntu.reg file to install a right-click option for restoring a .vhdx.
   - Right-click on .vhdx and select RestoreToWSLUbuntu. 
   - The 1st word of the restore file is the name of the distro that will be restored. 
     For example: ubuntu-11-06-2023-21-41.vhdx will restore and show up in wsl -l -v as ubuntu.
   - The ext4.vhdx restored file will be located in the folder c:\wsldistro in a sub-folder matching the distro name.

For hot keys under windows, I use Executor. See this website https://executor.dk
1. Backup hotkey
   Command: C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
   Parameter: -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File  "C:\Development\tools\wsltools\bkupwslubuntu.ps1"
2. Hotkey for starting Windows Terminal
   Command: wt
   Parameter: -p Ubuntu
3. I also have hotkeys for starting Docker Desktop and for opening the backup directory.
